- **Statistical & Economic Modeling** - Log-log regression, own-price and cross-price elasticity modeling, interpolation methods (PCHIP, Cubic Spline), outlier analysis (IQR)
- **Mathematical Optimization** - Objective functions (revenue and margin), business and competitive constraints, constrained optimization using SLSQP and trust-constr (SciPy)
- **Data Engineering** - Data ingestion and versioning on AWS S3, Parquet-based storage, modular pipelines, large-scale SKU processing
- **MLOps & Production** - Databricks Jobs, CRON scheduling, parallel execution, pipeline monitoring, model governance and traceability
- **Libraries & Frameworks** - Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Prophet, Scikit-learn, SciPy
- **Tools & Platforms** - AWS S3, Databricks, Cognos, Git, Power BI, Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab
- **Languages** - English (Intermediate), Spanish (Intermediate), Japanese (Basic)

### Currently Learning
Currently deepening my knowledge of statistical modeling and linear regression, while improving practical skills in Python data manipulation (NumPy, Pandas) and MongoDB administration, with a focus on production-oriented data systems.
